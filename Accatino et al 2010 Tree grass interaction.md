Article history:

The mechanisms permitting the co-existence of tree and grass in savannas have been a source of

contention for many years. The two main classes of explanations involve either competition for

resources, or differential sensitivity to disturbances. Published models focus principally on one or the

other of these mechanisms. Here we introduce a simple ecohydrologic model of savanna vegetation

involving both competition for water, and differential sensitivity of trees and grasses to ﬁre

disturbances. We show how the co-existence of trees and grasses in savannas can be simultaneously

controlled by rainfall and ﬁre, and how the relative importance of the two factors distinguishes between

dry and moist savannas. The stability map allows to predict the changes in vegetation structure along

gradients of rainfall and ﬁre disturbances realistically, and to clarify the distinction between climate-

and disturbance-dependent ecosystems.

1\. Introduction

According to rangeland ecology literature (e.g.,Westoby et al.,

1989; Briske et al., 2003), savannas can be viewed in light of range

The term savanna describes ecosystems characterized by the

co-dominance of trees and grasses. The proportions of tree and

grass can vary greatly. Savannas occur in areas with annual

rainfall from 300 to 1800 mm, and are commonly split into dry

and moist forms (semi-arid and wet, nutrient-rich and nutrient-

poor, ﬁne-leafed, and broad-leafed are all synonyms for this

division). In dry savannas, the grass primary production is a

strongly increasing function of annual rainfall, while in moist

savannas the relation is weak or absent. The transition between

dry and moist savannas can be located around 500ꢀ700 mm of

annual rainfall (e.g., Scholes and Walker, 1993; Sankaran et al.,

2005).

succession or state-and-transition models. In range succession

models, savannas are a point in a continuous spectrum whose

extremes are grassland and forest. Disturbances like ﬁre or

herbivores just modify the tree–grass ratio along this spectrum

with reversible transformations. In state-and-transition models

multiple stable states are possible, and the rangeland dynamics is

explained through transitions (reversible or irreversible and

abrupt) due to disturbances between steady states. The existence

of multiple stable states has been pointed out by Dublin (1995),

van de Koppel et al. (1997), Anderies et al. (2002), van Langevelde

et al. (2003), D’Odorico et al. (2006), Hanan et al. (2008), Okin

et al. (2009), Baudena et al. (2010).

What is special about the savanna environment that allows trees

and grasses to coexist, as opposed to the general pattern in other

areas of the world where either one or the other functional type is

dominant?

This has been referred to as the ‘savanna question’ (Sarmiento,

1984). The question has attracted the interest of many scientists

in the last forty years: Walter (1971), Walker and Noy-Meir

(1982), Scholes and Walker (1993), Scholes and Archer (1997),

Sankaran et al. (2004), Sankaran et al. (2005), D’Odorico et al.

(2006), Scheiter and Higgins (2007), L u¨ ttge (2008), Hanan et al.

(2008), and Leibold (2008), among others.

According to savannas ecology literature (e.g., Sankaran et al.,

2004), the ‘savanna question’ is addressed within paradigms of

equilibrium and disequilibrium. The former interprets the

savanna as a long term stable state due to internal factors, being

disturbances modiﬁers of the tree–grass ratio. According to the

latter, savanna is an unstable state and its existence is due to

disturbances which maintain the tree–grass mixture, preventing

the achievement of the complete dominance of trees or grasses.

Within the equilibrium paradigm, the tree–grass co-existence

has been explained through competition based mechanisms

(e.g., root niche separation or balanced competition), while

demographic bottleneck mechanisms are related to the disequili-

brium paradigm (see Sankaran et al., 2004).

The archetypal competition-based model of tree–grass co-

grasses as the superior competitor, but having roots restricted to the

topsoil layer whereas trees roots both in the topsoil and subsoil. The

niche separation avoids the tree–grass competition and allows the

stable co-existence. The absence of niche separation in fact would

lead to one plant functional group equilibrium. Models based on the

‘Walter hypothesis’ have been widely applied in literature (Walker

et al., 1981; Walker and Noy-Meir, 1982; Eagleson and Segarra,

1985; van Langevelde et al., 2003).

Some experiments and observations have supported ‘Walter

hypothesis’ (Knoop and Walker, 1985; Sala et al., 1989; Pelaez

et al., 1994) but many others have cast doubts on the existence of

vertical rooting niche separation (Scholes and Walker, 1993;

Belsky, 1990; Le Roux et al., 1995; Mordelet et al., 1997; Smit and

Rethman, 2000; Hipondoka et al., 2003).

In ‘balanced competition’ models, the superior competitor

limits its own abundance and the inferior competitor can grow; in

other terms the intra-speciﬁc competition of the superior

competitor is stronger than the inter-speciﬁc competition (Amar-

asekare, 2003). For example, the water scarcity can limit the

abundance of trees in savanna so that grass can grow.

In the past two decades, the disequilibrium paradigm has

gained favor over the equilibrium one (Higgins et al., 2000; Jeltsch

et al., 2000; van Langevelde et al., 2003; D’Odorico et al., 2006;

Gardner, 2006; Hanan et al., 2008). The near-universal ﬁnding

that tree cover increased when ﬁres are excluded from savannas

(Trapnell, 1959; Shackleton and Scholes, 2000) and that elephants

(see the several studies reviewed in Kerley et al., 2008), giraffes

(Pellew, 1983) and other herbivores can substantially modify

savanna structure, lend evidence to this school of thought.

Fire is an intrinsic characteristic of many savanna ecosystem

allowing tree–grass co-existence: trees at the seedling stage can

be easily attachable by ﬂames, thus ﬁre acts as bottleneck in trees

demography preventing the canopy closure. Fire has been

explicitly included in many savanna models (Hochberg et al.,

1994; Anderies et al., 2002; van Langevelde et al., 2003; D’Odorico

et al., 2006; Beckage et al., 2009) and has often been described as

dependent on the availability of fuel load, that in arid ecosystems

is given by dead grass. Hanan et al. (2008) and Baudena et al.

(2010) have considered explicitly the demography of trees

underlining the asymmetry of the ﬁre effects between saplings

and adult trees. This asymmetry can allow the survivorship of

trees population at low densities thanks to mechanisms of

‘storage effect’ that compensate the loss of young trees due to

demographic bottlenecks with a very low mortality of adult trees

(Warner and Chesson, 1985). In addition, various studies focused

on ﬁre as cause of bistability in rangelands (Anderies et al., 2002;

van Langevelde et al., 2003; Okin et al., 2009).

Simple (non-spatial) models of savanna dynamics, available in

literature, focus the attention principally on one mechanism at a

time. Competition mechanisms are considered by Walker et al.

(1981), Walker and Noy-Meir (1982), Eagleson and Segarra

(1985), Fernandez-Illescas and Rodriguez-Iturbe (2004), Baudena

et al. (2010), while disturbances-driven mechanisms are used by

Casagrandi and Rinaldi (1999), D’Odorico et al. (2006), Hanan

et al. (2008), Beckage et al. (2009).

Sankaran et al. (2004) point out the necessity to take into

account both disturbances and competition for resources simul-

taneously in order to capture their relative importance in shaping

the different types of savannas.

van Langevelde et al. (2003) represent the savanna vegetation

through a simple model of two equations (one for tree and one for

grass) considering the joint role of water (through the root niche

separation mechanism) and disturbances (ﬁre and herbivores)

that remove grasses and trees. In arid and semi-arid ecosystems

the dynamics of soil water is closely linked to the dynamics of

vegetation (Scholes and Walker, 1993; Rodriguez-Iturbe and

Porporato, 2004), thus in our approach, we will consider explicitly

the soil water in the root zone as a state variable.

Here, we address the ‘savanna question’ including in an

ecohydrologic model balanced competition and bottleneck me-

chanisms. We propose a space implicit model of tree–grass

dynamics competiting for soil water and perturbated by ﬁre. In

Section 2, the savanna is described through a set of three

differential equations including the dynamics of trees, grasses,

and soil water, fed by rainfall, and disturbed by ﬁre. The

variability of the model’s parameters is investigated and the

stability analysis is presented. In Section 3, changes of vegetation

structure along gradients of rainfall and ﬁre frequency are

predicted using the stability map in the rainfall–ﬁre frequency

space. The role of rainfall and ﬁre frequency in maintaining dry

and moist savannas is illustrated.

interval [0, 1]: T¼0 means that trees are not present in the area,

T¼1 means that the area is fully covered by trees, and similarly

for grasses. In addition, the values of T and G must satisfy also the

condition 0rT+Gr1. <sup>c</sup><sub>T</sub> and <sup>c</sup><sub>G</sub> are the colonization rates,

T

trees are absent (the term (1ꢀT)), while grasses can colonize

places where both trees and grass are absent (the term (1ꢀGꢀT)).

See Tilman (1994) for further details.

2\.2. Fire forcings and tree–grass dynamics

There is much evidence that ﬁre inﬂuences the balance

between tree and grass in savannas (e.g., Scholes and Walker,

1993). The occurrence and spread of ﬁres depends on the

presence of sufﬁcient mass of dry plant material to provide a

near-continuous fuel load. The fuel for savannas ﬁres is mostly

provided by dead grass: the ﬁre may only burn following years of

adequate rainfall and low herbivory, when sufﬁcient grass

biomass has accumulated (Bond and van Wilgen, 1996).

Based on data from 854 sites in Africa, Sankaran et al. (2005)

identify

a

distinction between savannas receiving less that

The ﬁre acts differently on grass and tree. Fire occurs mainly in

the dry season, when the perennial grasses are dormant. It

consumes grass leaves as fuel, but does not generally kill the

dormant grass buds at/or below the soil surface. The ﬁre also

consumes tree leaf litter, but if grass is completely absent it is

very difﬁcult for ﬁre to propagate. The living tree biomass is

ꢁ650–700 mm of annual rainfall (dry savannas) and those receiving

more (moist savannas). The former are stable, and disturbances

modify the woody cover, but are not necessary for tree–grass co-

existence; the latter are unstable and maintained by disturbances, in

this case they are essential for the maintenance of a savanna.

seldom ignited, but dead wood and leaf litter may be, and the

aboveground live tree biomass can be killed by exposure to ﬁre.

Small trees are the most vulnerable, since they may be entirely

within the ﬂame zone. Mature trees are little affected, since their

bark protects the main stem and their buds (dormant in the ﬁre

season) are held above the ﬂame zone.

surface is more-or-less horizontal, and that all the rainfall

inﬁltrates in the soil. The term (p/w<sub>1</sub>)S is the deep percolation,

i.e., the amount of rainfall exceeding the root zone capacity

percolating beyond the root zone depth.

Note that in literature, the deep percolation is represented

through a non-linear function of S (e.g., Rodriguez-Iturbe and

Porporato, 2004). However, since the deep percolation is not a

prominent feature of the hydrology of semi-arid systems (often less

than 1% of the budget drains to the water table, e.g., Scholes and

Walker, 1993, and references therein), we have made the linear

assumption to keep the model tractable as ﬁrst approximation.

The term eS(1ꢀTꢀG) is the evaporation from bare soil. It

depends on the fraction of bare soil, (1ꢀTꢀG), and the available

soil moisture S. The term t ST is the water uptake by tree and t SG

To take into account explicitly the ﬁre forcing in our model

system, Eq. (1), the removal term for grass, ꢀd G, is split in two:

G

ꢀfG describing the consumption of grass by ﬁres, and ꢀd

G

GO

representing the grass reduction due to the other causes such as

mortality and herbivores, similarly to van Langevelde et al.

(2003); while in the equation for trees the reduction at above-

ground cover due to ﬁre (ꢀd fGT) is determined by the amount of

The dynamics of trees and grass are linked to the dynamics of

ﬁre frequency, while the coefﬁcient d<sub>F</sub> [ꢀ] is a function of both

the frequency and intensity of ﬁre, where grass fuel load is a

proxy for ﬁre intensity. In Eq. (2) no differentiation is made

between juvenile and adult trees. However, the value of the

parameter d<sub>F</sub> can provide information about the mean age of

trees. High values of d<sub>F</sub> represent sites where trees are young, and

vulnerable to ﬁre, while low values of d<sub>F</sub> represent sites where

trees are adult and little affected by ﬁre.

Soil water is a direct link between the hydrologic cycle and the

ecological system. In arid and semi-arid environments, the water

present in the rooting zone is the primary determinant of

vegetation composition, structure, and function. Root zone water

content is highly variable in time. In contrast to the ‘Walter

hypothesis’ (Walter, 1971), where grasses have access only to the

topsoil layer, and trees extend their roots both in topsoil and

subsoil layers for water uptake, here we assume that the depth at

which trees and grasses extract water is the same.

The annual rainfall, p, and the ﬁre frequency, f, are environmental

forcings treated here as constants. In reality, they are stochastic

variables as assumed by Fernandez-Illescas and Rodriguez-Iturbe

(2004) in the case of rainfall forcing and by D’Odorico et al. (2006)

and Hanan et al. (2008) in the case of ﬁre disturbances.

Their stochastic behavior can be considered through the

statistical dynamical approach outlined by De Michele et al.

(2007). The analytical results obtained here do not depend on

rainfall and ﬁre stochasticity, so our mathematical treatment is

kept as simple as possible.

We further assume that the water table is so deep that it does

S is dimensionless assuming values in the closed interval [0, 1], in

particular S¼0 corresponds to completely dry soil, and S¼1 to

completely saturated soil. The condition S¼1 rarely happens in

semi-arid and arid savannas, particularly if the balance is

investigated at seasonal or annual time scales.

2\.5. Values of the parameters

The values of the parameters in Eq. (4) are determined as

follows. The depth of the root zone z is in the range 0.1–1 m, while

the porosity n in the range 0.05–0.55, Scholes and Walker (1993).

The colonization and loss rates are obtained by consideration of

the time scales necessary to attain the steady state. For the loss

rates we consider one plant functional group at the time, in

absence of ﬁre and soil water. Under these conditions, the

vegetation declines to zero exponentially, i.e. p exp(ꢀdt).

Making hypotheses about the time needed for each functional

type to go close to extinction starting from its maximum value,

we can estimate the mortality rate d. Savanna trees have a

lifespan in the order of E10–100 years, consequently d<sub>T</sub> E0.03–

Grass tillers, on the other hand, live for 1–3 years, consequently

d<sub>GO</sub> E1–3 yrꢀ<sup>1</sup>. For the colonization rates, once we have ﬁxed a

value for the loss rates, we estimate the time interval necessary to

the vegetation to attain its steady state, with unlimited resources

2\.7.1. Conditions for the spreading of a single functional type

The conditions for the spreading of a single functional type are

determined by considering one functional type at a time. The type

can have a positive stable equilibrium if its colonization rate is

greater than its mortality rate. In Eq. (4) this is satisﬁed by the

condition S4l<sub>T</sub> for trees, and by S4l<sub>G</sub> for grass, where S is

the soil moisture at the equilibrium. Note that if l<sub>G</sub> 41, then the

conditions for the grass spreading can never be met because S

takes values in the closed interval [0, 1]. Similarly, if l<sub>T</sub> 41 then

the condition for the tree spreading can never be satisﬁed.

The transect 50rpr1800 mm yrꢀ<sup>1</sup> at f¼0.2 yr<sup>ꢀ1</sup> is charac-

terized by a continuous change of vegetation, without abrupt

transitions, from unvegetated, to (desert) grassland, to savanna, to

forest.

This sequence has been described as the sub-tropical succession

according to Shmida and Burgess (1988). In Fig. 2 note that the

boundary between grassland and savanna is located at different

values of annual rainfall (p) depending on the ﬁre frequencies (f).

C–D are rainfall gradients, in low and high ﬁre conditions, respectively.

savanna is small. In Fig. 2, the transect A–B is representative of ﬁre

words, although grass is present, this vegetation is a forest, closed

woodland or thicker, Scholes (1997). In Fig. 2 the region 3 has

been divided into two subregions (3a) and (3b) by the isoline

T¼0.8 (gray line), i.e., the tree density corresponding to the

canopy closure, above which virtually no grass would be present

because of shading.

conditions with 0rfr0.6 yrꢀ . In absence of ﬁre disturbance

1

(f¼0 yrꢀ ), the same vegetation sequence is observed with the

only difference being the tree coverage at a given rainfall, see

Fig. 3a and b. This means that the ﬁre inﬂuences the tree–grass

ratio in region 3, and the grass coverage in region 2, while the

rainfall availability determines the type of vegetation. Regions 2

and 3 could be designated climate-dependent ecosystems, following

the nomenclature suggested by Bond et al. (2003).

1

In region 4, the stable equilibrium is forest, as well as in region 5.

In region 4 grass cannot grow because the mortality due to ﬁre is

too high (i.e., very high ﬁre frequencies can only be tolerated if the

rainfall is also high). In region 5, the ﬁre is not sufﬁcient to prevent

the closure of the tree canopy — a condition that is widely

encountered. In both regions 4 and 5, the direct effect of ﬁre on

grass is greater than the indirect effect on trees. Regions 6 and 7 are

characterized by bistability. In region 6, the stable equilibria are

grassland and forest, while in region 7 are savanna and forest.

The bistability between savanna and forest has been found also

by da Silveira Lobo Sternberg (2001). The equilibrium state of the

system in the bistability regions depends on the initial condition

and on the history of disturbances (Solbrig et al., 1996).

The bistability in regions 6 and 7 is associated to the high ﬁre

frequency. Depending on initial condition, two scenarios are

possible: (1) ﬁre completely removes grasses leaving only trees

(forest), (2) ﬁre is enough to completely remove trees (region 6),

or to limit their abundance (region 7), but some grass is left.

Note that the boundaries of the regions are parameter-

dependent.

For values of annual rainfall in the range 100rpr600 mm

yrꢀ<sup>1</sup> the co-existence of tree and grass is permitted by the limited

amount of water resource, while the ﬁre inﬂuences the tree–grass

ratio only. The water scarcity limits the density of the superior

competitor, allowing the co-existence through mechanisms of

balanced competition.

Along the rainfall gradient the savanna equilibrium varies

continuously without abrupt or irreversible transitions. This

behavior is coherent with the equilibrium paradigm and the

range succession models philosophy. In this case, savannas can be

considered as broad ecotones between grasslands and closed

woodlands as noticed in Walter (1971). This type of savanna is

commonly called dry savanna (Sankaran et al., 2005).

3\.2. Vegetation changes along a rainfall gradient with frequent ﬁres

The transect C–D for high ﬁre frequency (f¼1 yrꢀ ) intersects

regions of bistability: this implies that the vegetation model

exhibits a hysteresis cycle (with abrupt changes) in terms of both

tree and grass.

equilibrium (pathway F-G-H). Further increasing the rainfall

leads to an abrupt transition from savanna to forest (pathway

H-I): grass goes to zero and trees increase sharply in coverage.

With further increases in p, the system remains in the forest state

(pathway I-D). In reverse, if the annual rainfall decreases

(pathway D-I-L-M-N) the system remains as forest until

the unvegetated state is attained. The existence of a ‘catastrophic’

transition from savanna to forest is in agreement with Sankaran

et al. (2005), who observe that when ﬁre is essential for

maintaining the savanna, then an abrupt, rather that gradual,

increase in the maximum value of woody coverage is expected.

From Fig. 3c and d, if the system is at forest equilibrium (e.g.,

point M or L), an intensive tree harvesting (i.e., deforestation or

high browsing pressure for instance by elephants) can provoke a

rapid transition to grassland (M-E) or savanna state (L-G). The

forest ecosystem can be recovered only by replanting or by an

increase of the annual rainfall over the catastrophic transition

(H-I). Abrupt transitions in space from forest to savanna or

grassland lead to patchy landscapes — a widely observed phenom-

enon at high values of annual rainfall (e.g., Murphy and Lugo, 1986).

absence of ﬁre disturbance), it is possible to observe a different

vegetation sequence. Thus ﬁre determines the type of vegetation

in this case and regions 4, 5, 6, 7 could be classiﬁed as ﬁre-

dependent ecosystems, according to Bond et al. (2003).

The alternation of stable states along the rainfall gradient and

the presence of abrupt transitions are coherent with the

disequilibrium paradigm and the state-and-transitions models

philosophy. Fire-dependent savannas exist because of ﬁres

causing bottlenecks in tree demography preventing the canopy

closure. Moreover, the persistence of grass in ﬁre-dependent

ecosystem is strengthened by the positive feedback between

grasses and ﬁre: more grasses means more fuel load, more ﬁre

implies less trees, and consequently more space available to

grasses and, thence, an increase in ﬁre fuel load; in case of grasses

extinction, trees grow undisturbed due to the absence of grass

and, thence, of ﬁre.

The grassland in region 6 can be denoted as false grassland

according to Acocks (1953) and Bond et al. (2003), because in

absence of ﬁre the vegetation should be more wooded.

For high values of annual rainfall, pZ1100 mm yrꢀ<sup>1</sup>, the co-

existence of tree and grass is permitted only by the high levels of

ﬁre disturbance. This type of savannas, disturbance-driven, is often

called moist savanna.

bistability. Tolerance to the ﬁre, especially in the juvenile life

stages, has been noted by Bond et al. (2003) as a key requirement

for savanna trees. In panel (b), the system can stay in savanna

(when the system is in region 7) and then pass into grassland

(when the system is in region 6). This is in agreement with the

school of thought according to which: ﬁre might be, in the long

term, the only management tool to maintain healthy grass

populations (e.g., Zimmermann et al., 2009 and reference therein).

If the increase of ﬁre is not gradual, abrupt transitions from

savanna to grassland or from savanna to forest are feasible.

4\. Conclusions

We present a simple ecohydrologic model of savanna vegeta-

tion, described through a set of three differential equations. The

space implicit model includes the dynamics of tree, grass, and soil

water forced by rainfall and ﬁre. This analytical (as opposed to

numerical simulation) model is unusual in that it combines both

competition- and disturbance-based mechanisms, and shows that

they occupy a continuum rather than being alternative descrip-

tions of savanna dynamics.

The stability map in the parameters space of rainfall and ﬁre

synthesizes the conditions for the different types of vegetation:

unvegetated, (desert) grassland, savanna, and forest. It helps to (1)

clarify that the co-existence of tree and grass is due to the

simultaneous inﬂuence of rainfall and ﬁre, and (2) distinguish the

two main types of savanna. For 100rpr600 mm yrꢀ the dry

savanna co-existence is permitted by the balanced competition

for limited rainfall and ﬁre inﬂuences only the tree–grass ratio.

The system would still be a savanna, even in the absence of ﬁre.

For rainfall above 1100 mm yrꢀ<sup>1</sup> the moist savanna co-existence

can only occur in the presence of a high level of ﬁre disturbance,

1

because the ecosystem would be a forest in the absence of ﬁre. In

the intermediate range, 600rpr1100 mm yrꢀ , savanna is the

result of the co-occurence of water limitation and ﬁre. The

stability map shows how dry savannas are stable equilibria, while

moist savannas are a bi-stable condition with forest. The stability

map allows also to predict the vegetation structure changes that

occur along gradients of rainfall and ﬁre frequency, and to clarify

the distinction between climate-dependent ecosystems and ﬁre-

dependent ecosystems.
